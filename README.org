* nlp-tools

This repo consist of a bunch of Clojure wrappers around Java libraries that I've found useful while NLPing

** Usage

Each wrapper has its own functionality and the use should be more or less evident from the code.
Only the models should be downloaded and put in a place in agreement with what the code expects.
